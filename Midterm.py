# Assignment Overview:
# You are required to create a Python program that will help a small business manage their
# customer orders. The program should handle the following tasks:
# 1. Customer Information Management (10 points)
# - Allow the user to input a customerâ€™s name and contact information (name, phone number, and
# email).
# - Validate that the phone number and email are in the correct format.

# 2. Product Ordering System (10 points)
# - The system should allow customers to choose products from a predefined list of at least five
# items, each with a unique ID, name, and price.
# - The user should be able to input the product ID and the quantity for each item they wish to
# purchase.
# - Calculate the total cost of the order before tax (8.25% tax rate applied).

# 3. Discounts and Final Calculation (10 points)
# - If the total order is more than $100, apply a 10% discount before calculating the tax.
# - Display the final order amount after applying the tax and any applicable discount.

# 4. Program Structure (10 points)
# - The program should include at least the following functions:
# - A function to input and validate customer information.
# - A function to display the product list.
# - A function to calculate the total cost and apply discounts.
# - A main function to control the flow of the program.

# 5. Error Handling (5 points)
# - Ensure that your program handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input when a number is
# expected).
# - If the user enters an invalid product ID, prompt them to try again.

# 6. Extra Credit (Optional) (10 points)
# - Add functionality to store each order in a text file and include a summary of all customer
# orders at the end of the session.
# - Allow the user to choose between delivery and pickup, and charge a flat $10 delivery fee if
# delivery is chosen.

# Submission Requirements:
# - Submit your Python program as a `.py` file.
# - Your code should be well-commented, with a header comment block explaining the program,
# its author, and the date. Each function should also have a brief comment explaining its purpose.
# - Include sample input and output in a separate text file.

# Grading Rubric:
# Functionality (10 points): Program meets all requirements and handles inputs correctly.
# Modularity (10 points): Use of functions to separate logic appropriately.
# Code Quality (10 points): Code is well-organized, readable, and follows proper naming
# conventions.
# Error Handling (5 points): Program handles errors without crashing.
# Comments and Documentation (5 points): Clear, meaningful comments throughout the code

# This program helps a small business to manage customer orders by collecting customer information,
# displaying available products, and processing orders. It uses regular expressions to validate phone
# numbers and email addresses, ensuring accurate input. Customers can enter product IDs and
# quantities, while the program calculates the total price, applies discounts for orders over $100, and
# adds sales tax at a rate of 8.25%. The user can choose between delivery (with a $10 fee) or pickup. Finally,
# the program summarizes the order details and saves them to a "receipt.txt" file. The main function
# controls the program flow, executing when the script runs directly.
